# mi_card

This is a side project for me. 
This project is basically a personal digital business card
It is a replacement for your default conacts app, but also helping you to add other info about the person you might forget.

### This project is created by a person who was just exposed to flutter, so please don't expect much.


### I am always looking for improvements, so if you have any idea on how to take this project further, ping me on master.guru.raghav@gmail.com, or just upload an issue.
